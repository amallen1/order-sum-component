## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out the Order Summary Component and get it looking as close as the provided design as possible. This challenge was done without access to the design files and rather by estimating sizes of elements. However, the style guide provided by Frontend Mentor helped by providing colors, font-sizes, font-family, etc.

Users should be able to:
- See hover states for interactive elements
